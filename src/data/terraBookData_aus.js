          story:
            "Liam woke before sunrise near the eucalypt forests of New South Wales. No kookaburra laughter today. The trees looked weak—pale leaves, brittle branches. Grandfather whispered, “Too many were cut. The forest is suffering.” Even the breeze felt warm and heavy.",

            "By noon, the air felt like a furnace. Thin eucalypt shade gave little relief; hot wind carried dust. Liam fanned himself while his sister wiped sweat. “The Earth is burning,” Grandfather said. Liam wished for clouds that never came.",
