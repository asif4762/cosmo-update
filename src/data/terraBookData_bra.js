          story:
            "Lucas woke up in a small village on the edge of the Amazon. Usually the morning sang with macaws and toucans. Today, it was quiet. The mahogany and Brazil nut trees looked tired—leaves thin, branches drooping. His grandmother touched a trunk and whispered, “Too many trees have fallen, filho.” The air felt heavy and hot, even before sunrise.",

          story:
            "Lucas remembered running under giant trees while monkeys chattered above. Now, wide patches were gone—burned ground and cattle ranches spread where forest had been. The soil was dry, rivers were lower, animals had vanished. “Where will the jaguars and parrots go?” he asked. The forest answered with silence.",

          story:
            "Rain came unpredictably. Some months, rivers shrank and the land cracked. Other times, sudden storms flooded homes and fields. “The rains no longer follow the old ways,” his mother said. Lucas watched water rise and thought about the food that would be lost.",

          story:
            "By noon, the heat felt like a furnace. The few trees left gave little relief. Lucas fanned himself while his sister hid in a thin patch of shade. “The Earth is burning,” Grandfather muttered. Lucas looked up, wishing for the clouds that once cooled the forest.",

            "Manaus was crowded. Boats, buses, and cars filled the air with noise. Streets and buildings stretched in every direction. Lucas looked for trees but found only a few, dusty and tired, trapped between walls and asphalt. He missed the deep green and wild songs of the Amazon.",
