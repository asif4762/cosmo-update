          story:
            "Ritu woke before sunrise. The koel was quiet. The mango tree outside looked sick—thin branches, few leaves. Grandfather touched the bark and whispered, “They cut too many trees.” The air felt hot and dry, even before the sun rose.",

          story:
            "The monsoon came late. When rain finally arrived, it was too much, too fast. Ponds overflowed and fields flooded. Rice seedlings washed away. “Rain has changed,” Mother sighed. “Sometimes none, sometimes too much.” Ritu wondered how they would eat.",

            "By midday the air felt like burning coal. The mango's thin shade no longer cooled. Her brother fanned himself with cardboard. Grandfather wiped his forehead with a gamcha. “The Earth is burning,” he muttered. The sky stayed empty and blue.",

          story:
            "Dhaka was crowded and loud. Horns, buses, wires across the sky. Everywhere was concrete—buildings, walls, roads. Ritu searched for trees but found only a few, small and dusty by the roadside. She missed the cool forest and the birds.",
